Multitenancy is more complex problem for access control than system without it.
That is even more complex problem once advanced multitenancy model is involved.

This article show basic implementation of access control of multitenancy system where data belongs to workspaces.
An user belongs to a single workspace, and we want to ensure that the user operates within its own workspace.

## Access Control Elements

System supports following principals:
* `anonymous`
* `authenticated`
* `impersonated` - when admin user impersonates as someone else

This could be represented by following structures.
```typescript
import {Principal as _Principal} from '@pallad/access-control';

export type Principal = Principal.ImpersonatedUser | Principal.User | _Principal.Anonymous;
export namespace Principal {
	export class User {
		readonly kind = 'principal';
		readonly type = 'user';

		constructor(readonly id: number, readonly workspaceId: number) {
			Object.freeze(this);
		}
	}

	export class ImpersonatedUser {
		readonly kind = 'principal';
		readonly type = 'impersonated-user';

		constructor(readonly impersonatorUsername: string, readonly targetUser: User) {
			Object.freeze(this);
		}
	}
}
```

Now we need to represent subjects and we're going to use [`@pallad/entity-ref`](https://github.com/pallad-ts/entity-ref) for it.
```typescript
import {createFactory} from "@pallad/entity-ref";
export namespace Subject {
	export const Article = createFactory(
		'article',
		(id: number, workspaceId: number) => ({id, workspaceId})
	);

	export const Workspace = createFactory(
		'workspace',
		(id: number) => ({id})
	);
}
```

## Policy

For policy definition we're going to use `createPolicy` from `AccessQueryPreset` for better type hints and filtering out all queries we do not care about.
```typescript
import {AccessControl} from '@pallad/access-control';
import {AccessQueryPreset, Principal, Subject} from './AccessQuery';

const accessControl = new AccessControl();
accessControl.registerPolicy(
	AccessQueryPreset
		.Article
		.accessQueryPreset
		.createPolicy(({action, subject, principal}) => {
            // everyone can read
			if (action === 'read') {
				return true;
			}

			// for impersonated and authenticated user allow only if actions are run against same workspace
			const workspaceId = Subject.Workspace.is(subject) ? subject.data.id : subject.data.workspaceId;
			if (principal instanceof Principal.ImpersonatedUser) {
				// and impersonated user can't publish
				return workspaceId === principal.targetUser.workspaceId && action !== 'publish';
			} else if (principal instanceof Principal.User) {
				return workspaceId === principal.workspaceId;
			}
		})
)
```

## Service

According to [good practices](/access-control/good-practices) we're no longer using access control checks at endpoint level but moving them to service.

Truncating for brevity - [full code available here](https://github.com/pallad-ts/access-control/tree/master/examples/tenancy/src/ArticleService.ts).

```typescript
export class ArticleService {
	constructor(private accessControl: AccessControl,
				private aclHelper: ACLHelper,
				private articleRepository: ArticleRepository) {
	}

	async findAll(principal: Principal) {
		const scope = this.aclHelper.assertScopeWorkspaceForPrincipal(principal);
		const subject = Subject.Workspace.fromScope(scope);
		await this.accessControl.assertIsAllowed(
			AccessQueryPreset.Article.canRead(subject, principal)
		);

		const canReadDraft = await this.accessControl.isAllowed(
			AccessQueryPreset.Article.canReadDraft(subject, principal)
		);

		return this.articleRepository.findAll(scope, {
			onlyPublished: !canReadDraft
		})
	}

	async create(principal: Principal, input: Article.Input) {
		const scope = this.aclHelper.assertScopeWorkspaceForPrincipal(principal);
		const subject = Subject.Workspace.fromScope(scope);
		await this.accessControl.assertIsAllowed(
			AccessQueryPreset.Article.canCreate(subject, principal)
		);
		return this.articleRepository.create(scope, input);
	}

	async update(principal: Principal, id: number, input: Article.Input) {
		const scope = this.aclHelper.assertScopeWorkspaceForPrincipal(principal);

		const article = this.articleRepository.assertById(scope, id);
		await this.accessControl.assertIsAllowed(
			AccessQueryPreset.Article.canUpdate(Subject.Article.fromEntity(article), principal)
		);

		return this.articleRepository.update(scope, id, input);
	}
}

```

## Repository scopes
You might notice the concept of `scope`.

Scope is a note for repository to filter out all records outside of tenancy scope.
For example passing `new ScopeWorkspace(1)` is telling repository to operate only on records from `workspaceId = 1`.

Think about it:
* You can try to find article by id from other workspace but scope will filter it out.
* You can try to update someone else article but again - scope will filter it out

Scope should be obtained based on principal and if that is not possible it might suggest the operation should not be available for given principal.

### Unsafe global scope
Example repository contains example of `ScopeUnsafeGlobal`
```typescript
export class ScopeUnsafeGlobal {
	readonly kind = 'scope';

	readonly type = 'unsafe-global';
	static INSTANCE = new ScopeUnsafeGlobal();

	constructor() {
		Object.freeze(this);
	}
}
```

This kind of scope should be used in rare cases where repository **should not** filter out records but rather allow to work on all of them.

You might ask - why?

Why not making scope optional?
```typescript
class ArticleRepository {
	delete(scope: ScopeWorkspace | undefined, id: number) {

	}
}
```

Due to reasons...
* to avoid potential mistakes (scope not obtained correctly?)
* to give a reminder for developer that it is dangerous operation

Calling `articleRepository.delete(undefined, 1)` comes too easy but
`articleRepository.delete(ScopeUnsafeGlobal.INSTANCE, 1)` gives necessary hint that you need to think twice before committing it.
