Should be just a name of an action.

There are no special requirements for it.
The only thing that you might be tempted to do is to use subject related names like `create-article` or `read-author`.
Obviously you can do that but using proper subject is rather better approach especially when [access query preset](/access-control/defining-access-query/access-query-preset) is used.
