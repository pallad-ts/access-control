It is crucial to be able to define good, unambiguous parameters for access query.
Thanks for them Access Control might as granular as you need and properly do its job.

It is impossible to define all kind of principals, actions and subjects within a single package.
Therefore, you should be creating as many options to define access query elements as you need.

:::tip

The elements of Access Query **must** contain as many details as you need to perform checks on a policy level.

:::

For example, based on the [tutorial](/tutorial) it is impossible to define access control policies based on IP address of the request.

In order to achieve that you must inject that information to `Principal` somehow.

Let's redefine our principal then

```typescript
// this needs to be obtained from a request somehow
export interface PrincipalMeta {
	ipAddress: string;
}

export interface Principal {
	wrapped: 'logged-in' | _Principal.Anonymous;
	meta: PrincipalMeta
}
```

The way of obtaining principal also changes
```typescript

function getWrappedPrincipalFromRequest(req: express.Request): Principal {
	if (req.headers.authorization === 'itsme') {
		return 'logged-in';
	}
	return _Principal.Anonymous.INSTANCE;
}

function getPrincipalFromRequest(req: express.Request) {
    return {
        wrapped: getWrappedPrincipalFromRequest(req),
        meta: {
            ipAddress: req.header('x-forwarded-for') || req.socket.remoteAddress
        }
    }
}
```

Example policy
```typescript
accessControl
	.registerPolicy(({action, subject, principal}) => {
        // anonymous user from private IP address class can read articles
		if (_Principal.Anonymous.is(principal.wrapped) && principal.meta.ipAddress.startsWith('10.0.0.')) {
			return action === 'read' && subject === 'article';
		}
	})
```
