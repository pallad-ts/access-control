Once you have defined possible options for subject and action you might realize that certain combinations of them should not be possible.
For example you don't have action `truncate` on subject `article`.
Therefore policies needs to be aware of that and filter out unsupported actions for certain subjects.

That is why in tutorial we've explicitly defined set of possible actions and filter out unsupported ones:

```typescript
import {Action} from './AccessQueryElements';
const allowedActionsForArticle = new Set<Action>([
	'update',
	'read',
	'read-draft',
	'create',
	'publish',
	'delete'
]);

accessControl
	.registerPolicy(({action, subject, principal}) => {
		if (principal === 'logged-in') {
            // This is annooooyiiiing ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«
			return allowedActionsForArticle.has(action) && subject === 'article';
		}
	});
```

It is cumbersome and requires extra maintenance. There is better solution though.

Access Query Preset

Access Query Preset is available as separate package `@pallad/access-control-query-preset`.
```bash npm2yarn
npm install @pallad/access-control-query-preset
```

## What is it

Access Query Preset allows to define combination of `action` and `subject`.
```typescript
import {accessQueryPresetFactory} from "@pallad/access-control-query-preset";
const accessQueryPreset = accessQueryPresetFactory('article', create => ({
    // can principal read given article?
    canRead: create('read', Subject.Article),
	// can principal create article withing given workspace?
	canCreate: create('create', Subject.Workspace)
}));
```

Now you can create access query from it
```typescript

const accessQuery = accessQueryPreset.canRead(
	Subject.Article(1, 1),
	principal
);

accessControl.isAllowed(accessQuery)
```

Since preset aggregates all possible combinations of actions and subjects it can wrap
your policy function so it is never called for combinations that are not possible.

```typescript
accessControl.registerPolicy(
	accessQueryPreset.createPolicy(() => {
        console.log('policy called');
	})
)

// your policy will not be called since access query preset filtered out that access query for you
accessControl.isAllowed({action: 'random-one', subject: {}, principal: {}})

// `policy called`
accessControl.isAllowed(
    accessQueryPreset.canRead(
		Subject.Article(1, 1),
		principal
	)
);

```

Also maintains type safety!
```typescript
accessQueryPreset.createPolicy(({action, subject}) => {
	if (action === 'create') {
        // at this stage typescript knows that subject is `Subject.Workspace`
	} else {
        // at this stage typescript knows that subject is `Subject.Article`
	}
})
```

## Maintaining uniqueness

When your system gets more access query presets defined you might noticed that certain combinations of `action` and `subject` are not unique.

```typescript
const articleQueryPreset = accessQueryPresetFactory('article', c => ({
	canCreate: c('create', Subject.Workspace)
}));

const articleCategoryQueryPreset = accessQueryPresetFactory('article-category', c => ({
	// exactly same combination as above
	canCreate: c('create', Subject.Workspace)
}));
```

This might suggest that policy created from `articleQueryPreset` might be called even we create access query from `articleCategoryQueryPreset`.
```typescript
accessControl
	.registerPolicy(
		articleQueryPreset.createPolicy(() => {
			console.log('Article Query Preset Policy called');
		})
	)
	.registerPolicy(
		articleCategoryQueryPreset.createPolicy(() => {
			console.log('Article Category Query Preset Policy called');
		})
	)
```

That is not the case actually
```typescript
accessControl.isAllowed(articleQueryPreset.canCreate(Subject.Workspace(1), principal));
// 'Article Query Preset Policy called'
// note that second policy was not called
```

This is because `AccessQueryPreset` do extra wrapping of a subject
with another object with `subjectType` property that allows to identify all queries from Access Query Preset.

That being said `AccessQueryPreset` should
