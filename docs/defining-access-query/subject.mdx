Represents entity, target, resource on which `action` has to be performed.

Let's discuss few possible example how to define it, and how detailed it has to be.

## String

Just a string representing type of the subject.
```typescript
export type Subject = 'article' | 'author' | 'category';
```

This can work only for very simple systems, without need for tenancy or more granular control.

## EntityRef



## Custom

## PermissionSet
// TODO
// Talks about tenancy
