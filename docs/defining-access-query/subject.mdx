Represents entity, target, resource on which `action` has to be performed.

Let's discuss few possible example how to define it, and how detailed it has to be.

## String

Just a string representing type of the subject.
```typescript
export type Subject = 'article' | 'author' | 'category';
```

This can work only for very simple systems, without need for tenancy or more granular control.

## EntityRef
For complex systems you will need to use real entities within access control.

Having entity as a pure object seems to be a great idea but soon you realize that has its own problems.
Lets use following entity as an example.

```typescript
const article = {
    id: 1,
	title: 'Cillum exercitation occaecat duis id sunt ad irure veniam qui',
	content: "Dolor labore dolor, laboris occaecat aute culpa.",
	isPublished: true
};
```

How are you going to assess on `policy` level that subject is an article?
You can check for existence of `isPublished` property but for complex systems it is hard to maintain all
that kind of checks and maintaining them to be mutually exclusive.

Once another entity with `isPublished` property gets added to the system yoo won't realize that currently existing policy will take-over handling of access control it.

In theory you can just create a class and use it for identification:

```typescript
class Article {
	readonly id: number;
    readonly title: string;
    readonly content: string;
    readonly isPublished: boolean;
    constructor(data: Article) {
		Object.assign(this, data);
		Object.freeze(this);
	}
}

const article = new Article({
    id: 1,
	title: 'Cillum exercitation occaecat duis id sunt ad irure veniam qui',
	content: "Dolor labore dolor, laboris occaecat aute culpa.",
	isPublished: true
});


accessControl.registerPolicy(({action, principal, subject}) => {
    if (subject instanceof Article) {
        // assess access for Article subject
    }
})
```

We have solved problem of identifying subject at policy level. Much better but still has some problems.

Creating full entity object is not always possible and sometimes even too expensive.
Passing excess data (like title, content) to subject is also not needed for a policy to assess access.
This is especially true for systems where you need to send subject over the network to another system.

To solve that problem we have [entity-ref](https://github.com/pallad-ts/entity-ref).
It was designed, to create unambiguous, lightweight data structure that is easy to serialize, check type and ensure shape of data.

Thanks to it you can create set of factories to make creating entity-ref easier.

```typescript
import {createFactory} from '@pallad/entity-ref';

export const articleRefFactory = createFactory(
    'article', // uses `article` to uniquely identify type
	(id: string) => ({id}) // factory that defines shape of data for ref
);


// create lightweight ref object for an article with id `10`
const ref = articleRefFactory('10'); // {type: "article", data: {id: "10"}}

accessControl.registerPolicy(({action, principal, subject}) => {
    if (articleRefFactory.is(subject)) {
        // assess access for article
    }
})
```

For more information about entity-ref see [documentation](https://github.com/pallad-ts/entity-ref/tree/master).

## AccessQueryPreset

[Access Query Preset](/defining-access-query/access-query-preset) creates its own subject wrapper to ensure policies created from the preset will handle only access queries created from it.
That is highly recommended approach since it significantly simplifies policy management and ensure the handling of of access queries between policies will not overlap.

## Custom
Similarly to principal, listing all possibilities is not feasible therefore you should not hesitate to create your own type of principal or extend existing ones.
